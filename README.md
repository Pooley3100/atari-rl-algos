To run:
Run main.py

Options:

Settings.json has most of hyperparameters

To change algorithm change rlOption in main from 1-5 <p>
To change game pick from pong, space, breakout and lunar variables <p>
If Lunar game use basic model, else use advanced models.


Run plot.py to then visualize test run. 
playModel.py can also be used to use trained model weights.
